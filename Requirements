Requirements 
to make the project work

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04:**
   - The Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the presence of a person near the smart dustbin. It works by emitting high-frequency sound waves and measuring the time it takes for these waves to bounce back after hitting an object.
   - When a person approaches the dustbin, the sensor will detect their presence by measuring the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back from them.

2. **SG-90 Micro Servo Motor:**
   - The SG-90 micro servo motor is responsible for opening the top of the dustbin when a person is detected by the Ultrasonic sensor.
   - When the Arduino receives a signal from the Ultrasonic sensor indicating the presence of a person, it sends a control signal to the servo motor to rotate and lift the top of the dustbin.

3. **Arduino UNO:**
   - The Arduino UNO is the central control unit or "brain" of your project. It processes the data from the Ultrasonic sensor and controls the servo motor.
   - You'll need to write a program (code) for the Arduino that defines how it should respond to sensor data. This code will include logic to activate the servo motor when a person is detected.

4. **Dustbin:**
   - The dustbin is the physical container for your project. It's where the waste is collected.
   - The top of the dustbin is designed to open automatically when a person approaches, thanks to the servo motor's action, making it convenient for users to dispose of their trash.

In summary, the Ultrasonic sensor detects human presence, the Arduino processes this information, and the servo motor opens the dustbin's top in response. Together, these components create a smart dustbin that automatically opens when someone approaches to dispose of trash.
