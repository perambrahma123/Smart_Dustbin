automatically mouth opening dustbin on human detection near it.

This directory is dedicated to a smart dustbin system designed to enhance user convenience.
The system employs an Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 in conjunction with an SG-90 micro servo motor to automate the process of opening the dustbin when a user approaches it for disposal. The Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 plays a pivotal role by detecting user movement in its vicinity. Upon sensing this motion, the system activates the SG-90 micro servo motor, which, in turn, opens the dustbin's lid automatically.


This innovative solution offers a seamless and hygienic user experience, eliminating the need for manual lid operation and reducing the risk of contamination. By combining the precision of the Ultrasonic sensor and the efficient servo motor, this smart dustbin creates a responsive and hands-free interaction for users. With this project hosted on GitLab and Git, we aim to contribute to the advancement of smart and efficient waste management systems, promoting cleanliness and automation in everyday life.
